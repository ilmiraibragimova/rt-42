# rt-42

RT is a  ray tracer. It parses a 3D scene from a file and applies ray tracing algorithm to render the given scene. Note: this project was made for MacOS.

Installation: Clone or download this repository and run make in command line while in the root of the repository. This will build executable called RT. Makefile compiles SDL2 library and JSON library from source files (as stated in the subject, see rt.en.pdf) so building process might take some time.

Usage ./RT [filename] filename must contain path to a valid scene. If the scene is not valid, RT will write corresponding error on standard output.
